# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cardinal
- I'm a freelance graphic designer with a degree in computer science.
- There's not much to find here as I primarly use my account for private repos of various passion projects.
- If you'd like to contact me or learn more, visit my website: [cardinaldesign.io](https://www.cardinaldesign.io)
